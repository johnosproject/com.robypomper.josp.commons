The JOSP Core Commons is a simple software library that provides commons methods
and utils to the whole JOSP Project. A complete list of all provided methods and
utils can be found on his [specs](docs/specs.md) page.


## Import

To import this library into your own software, you can use following Gradle
dependency:

```groovy
// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.robypomper.josp/jospCommons
implementation group: 'com.robypomper.josp', name: 'jospCommons', version: '$VERSION'
```

At the [mvnrepository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.robypomper.josp/jospCommons)
you can find all published versions and other import example for different build systems.

### Logging

This library is based on the Simple Logging Facade 4 Java [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/)
logging system. That means you can use any SLF4J compatible logger system to
manage the logs generated by this library.

In order to configure and print log messages you must include a SLF4J implementation,
like the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl` and set up relative configs
file (`log4j2.xml` for org.apache.logging.log4j).

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Add log4j-slf4j2-impl as Gradle dependency
    runtimeOnly "org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl:2.20.0"
}
```

JOSP Commons' log messages can be grouped as the 5 library's main areas, plus
the JmDNS library's logger. So, in to the logging configs we can use the
following loggers to configure logging messages for the JOSP Common library:

* `com.robypomper.comm`
* `com.robypomper.discovery`
* `com.robypomper.josp`
* `com.robypomper.java`
* `com.robypomper.settings`
* `javax.jmdns`

Here an example for the `log4j2.xml` config file:

```xml
<Configuration>
    <Loggers>
        
        <Logger name="com.robypomper.comm" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="consoleWarning_fileInfo"/>
        </Logger>
        
        <Logger name="com.robypomper.discovery" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="consoleWarning_fileInfo"/>
        </Logger>
        
        <Logger name="com.robypomper.josp" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="consoleWarning_fileInfo"/>
        </Logger>
        
        <Logger name="com.robypomper.java" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="consoleWarning_fileInfo"/>
        </Logger>
        
        <Logger name="com.robypomper.settings" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="consoleWarning_fileInfo"/>
        </Logger>
        
        <Logger name="javax.jmdns" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="consoleNone_fileWarning"/>
        </Logger>
        
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```


## Develop

### Organization and conventions

This project is based on Gradle build system and then include his 8.3 wrapper.
It is possible execute the build system simply with the command:

```
PROJ_DIR$ ./gradlew         # on Linux
PROJ_DIR$ ./gradlew.bat     # on Windows
```

This project follow the JOSP Project convention starting from version 2.2.4.
That means the project configs are available in to the `gradle/josp_project.gradle`
file. In this file are defined all properties used along other Gradle scripts.
Others Gradle files help to keep consistency across all JOSP Project repositories.

* `gradle.build`: main Gradle file
* `gradle/josp_definitions.gradle`: define JOSP versions and project modes
* `gradle/josp_project.gradle`: define current project/repository
* `gradle/josp_versions.gradle`: define versions for current project and his dependencies
* `gradle/publications_repo.gradle`: add current project's publication urls as build system repositories
* `gradle/artifacts.gradle`: project's artifacts' definitions from their sourceSets until their publications
* `gradle/tests.gradle`: define project's tests (sourceSets and dependencies)
* `gradle/publications.gradle`: configure the remote publications including archives signature (if private access
  enabled)
* `gradle/wrapper.gradle`: add a "create wrapper" task

### Run and clean

* `./gradlew clean` \
  Clean the project dir.

### Build and publish

* `jar`: compile and assemble artifact's sources and resources.
* `jarDeps`: collect all artifact's dependencies.
* `jarDocs`: collect and compress all artifact's JavaDocs
* `jarSrc`: collect and compress all artifact's source files
* `javadoc`: (documentation) generate all artifact's JavaDocs

**NB:** All those `jar` tasks' outputs will be included into the main project publication.

* `publishToMavenLocal` \
  Copies all defined publications to the local Maven cache, including their
  metadata (POM files, etc.).
* `publish` \
  An aggregate task that publishes all defined publications to all defined
  repositories. It does not include copying publications to the local Maven
  cache.
* `publishJospCommonsToMavenLocal` \
  Copies the main project's publication to the local Maven cache along with the
  publicationâ€™s POM file and other metadata.
* `publishJospCommonsToMavenRepository` \
  Publishes the main project's publication to the repository named "Maven".

Local Maven cache, typically is placed into `$HOME/.m2/repository`. \
On other hands, the "Maven" repository is configured to upload artifacts to the
[Nexus/Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/) public repository. More info on
this repo at [Resources > Publication repo](#publication-repository) section.

### Tests

Current library tests (almost) all utilities provided.

Run the Gradle `check` task to run all tests included into the current repository.

* `./gradlew check` \
  Run all test from current repo
* `./gradlew test` \
  Run all unit test from current repo


## Resources

### Dependencies

This repo is part of the [John OS Project](https://www.johnosproject.com). This is the commons library for
the project, so it is required (directly or indirectly) from any JOSP component.
On the other side it depends on the [JOSP API](https://github.com/johnosproject/com.robypomper.josp.api)
component.

Here other external dependencies:

* `org.slf4j:slf4j-api`: Simple Logging Facade 4 Java [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/)
* `org.yaml:snakeyaml`: YAML manipulation [SnakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml)
* `com.github.scribejava:scribejava-core`: HTTP & OAuth2 manager [ScribeJava](https://github.com/scribejava/scribejava)
* `com.github.scribejava:scribejava-apis`: HTTP & OAuth2 manager [ScribeJava](https://github.com/scribejava/scribejava)
* `org.jmdns:jmdns`: Java (cross-platform) mDNS implementation [JmDNS](https://github.com/jmdns/jmdns)

This repo, depends also on the [ProjectLombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
to define POJO classes. This dependency is defined only for annotations and
compile time.

Dependencies' licences are listed at the [LICENCE_OTHER](LICENCE_OTHER.md) file.

### Publication repository

Artifact's remote publications allow publishing JOSP components to remote
repository and make them public available. Because of that artifact's remote
publications are available only if ```enablePrivate``` config is ```true```.

All artifacts will be published with the base group ```com.robypomper.josp```.
Java JOSP components are published on the maven repository [sonatype.org](https://oss.sonatype.org/)
where the ```com.robypomper``` was registered with
[OSSRH-45810](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-45810?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=595848#comment-595848)
issue request. That means, specific Nexus/Sonatype's user and password are
required to publish JOSP components, those credentials must be stored in the
`$USER_HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties` file.

Here an example of the `gradle.properties` file, where `sonatypeXY` props are
referred to the publication repo credentials; and the `signing.XY` props to the
local signing key.

```agsl
sonatypeUser={jira_username}
sonatypePassword={jira_password}

signing.keyId={last 8-digit of the GPG key}
signing.password={passphrase of the GPG key}
signing.secretKeyRingFile={file containing the GPG key}
```
